<h1>Exercise 1.2</h1>

<h2>Exercise 1</h2>
  * A collocation is a combination of two or more words that correspond to a conventional way of saying things. 
  E.g. fast food is normal to use, but speed food is weird.
  * They are characterized by a limited compositionality, their meaning cannot be can't be derived from their parts.
  * Well done is a collocation because if you exchange well with good it doesn't fit anymore,  while "a green dragon" is
  not since you can keep the meaning by changing green to another color and keep the phrase's meaning.
 
 
<h2>Exercise 2</h2>
  * Mean and variance is used to measure the average distance between words.
  * Hypothesis testing: Assume that co-occurences between words are by chance(H), compute the 
  probability of the event and if the probability is too low reject H.
  
<h2>Exercise 3</h2>
Expensive = 14500 <br>
Wine = 4500 <br>
Corpus = 15000000 <br>


Pr(expensive) = 14500/15000000<br>
Pr(wine) = 4500/15000000<br>
Pr(expensive wine)' = 4500/15000000 * 14500/15000000 = 2.9 * 10^-7<br>
Pr(expensive wine) = 7/15000000 = 4.667 * 10^-7<br>

t = ((4.667 - 2.9) * 10^-7)/(sqrt(4.667 * 10^-7)/15000000) = 1.0017590592405523<br>
t value is below 2.576 which is below our threshold(99.5%)<br>
